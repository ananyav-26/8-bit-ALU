Welcome to the 4-bit ALU system project! This project involves the design and implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL programming. The ALU can perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations essential for computer processors.

## Overview
An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial component of a computer processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers. This project focuses on creating a simple 4-bit ALU that can execute various functions such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR operations.

## Features
- Addition: Perform binary addition of two 4-bit numbers.
- Subtraction: Perform binary subtraction of two 4-bit numbers.
- Bitwise Increment: Perform bitwise increment on the operand.
- Bitwise Decrement: Perform bitwise decrement on the operand.
- Logical AND: Execute bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit numbers.
- Logical OR: Execute bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit numbers.
- Logical XOR: Execute bitwise XOR operation on two 4-bit numbers.

## Technologies Used
- VHDL: Hardware description language used for FPGA and ASIC design.
- Xilinx VIVADO: Software tool for synthesis and simulation of VHDL code.
- ModelSim: Optional simulation tool for verifying the functionality of the VHDL code.
